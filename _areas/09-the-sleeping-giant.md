* operated by Grista
* really just a barn with a couple of fireplaces, tables and benches
* a dirty, dangerous watering hole
* frequented by Redbrand thugs

#### Tap House Trouble

* Redbrands quieten down and look over as party enters
* they are drinking ale, manhandling a wench and eating roast chicken
* the server comes over offering ale
* "they've had the last of the chicken"
* a Redbrand (Polliver) comes over and places his ale on the table
* you should join us
* these peasants have always got something hidden away somewhere, gold, silver, daughters
* always something if you know how to make them talk
* you could do well for yourself, we certainly have been
* think about it we could do whatever we like
* these are our colours, no ones standing in our way
