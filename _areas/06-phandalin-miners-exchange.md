A trading post where local miners have their finds weighed, measured and paid out.  In the absence of a local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area.

There isn't any real gold rush but enough is hidden in nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

A great place to meet people who spend a lot of time in the surrounding area.
