### Rumours

Any NPC can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent The Sleeping Giant at the east end of town and they are trouble.

Narth an old farmer - Sister Garaele recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.

Elsa, gossipy barmaid - Daran Edermath (orchard keeper) is a former adventurer.

Lanar, a miner - Orc raiders have been seen on the east end of the Triboar Trail.  The Townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.

Trilena, innkeeper's wife - Thel Dendrar (local woodcarver) stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago and when they came by his shop and leered at his wife.  The ruffians murdered him.  Several townsfolk saw it happen.  The Redbrands grabbed his body and now his wife, daughter and son have gone missing too.

Pip, innkeeper's son - Qelline Alderleaf's son Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods but Redbrands almost caught him.

Freda, a weaver - The Redbrands hassle every business in town except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange.  They don't want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.
