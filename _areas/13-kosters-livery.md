A couple of stables and fenced off corral house horses and ponies for the towns visitors.

A couple of Redbrands keep their horses here.

#### Sword fight at the OK corral

* shouting and cussing from the livery boxes
* Wes flies out of the barn and lands in a pile in the dirt
* bleeding and bruised
* followed by a pissed off Redbrand and his friend
* taken offence at Wes' advice that hitting his horse will do no good
* "No one tells me what to do with my horse"
* "I hope you are ready for a beating son"
* Yara looks on and asks any party members if they will let this happen
