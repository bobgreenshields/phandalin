As the players walk through the streets they come across 3 Redbrands hassling an old man for money.  The trio is a big brute and two young recruits.  The brute instructs one of the recruits to get some money from the old man, resulting in him striking the aged fellow.

They were being watched by Nela Hillwater (the old lady from the caves) who strides up to the recruit and slaps him around the face, saying "Your mother and father would be disgusted with you."  He's a distant nephew.

The recruit doesn't know what to do.  "She's my aunt."

The brute asks him, "Are you just going to take that?  Teach her a lesson." and passes him a cudgel.
