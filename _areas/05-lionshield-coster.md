Owned by the Lionshields, merchant company based in the city of Yartar, several hundred miles to the east.  They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region but this outpost has been hit hard by banditry.

In the back room Linene keeps a supply of armour and weapons, all of which are for sale.  Won't sell to anyone Linene thinks will be a threat to the town.
