Fat pompous human male.

* current townmaster
* completely intimidated by the Redbrands
* "They're just a mercenary guild and not all that much trouble, really."

#### Riling up the mob

* strangers come in to town and start trouble
* killing townfolk just like you and me
* having a quiet drink at the inn
* what right do they have to kill folk?
* they want to take over our town
* rightfully elected townmaster attacked and thrown in jail
* who will be next?

#### The Redbrands

* not that bad
* a town needs an armed militia
* who will protect us now

#### Orc Trouble

* looking for someone to head east on Triboar Trail
* travellers have reported trouble with a band of orcs
* near Wyvern Tor
