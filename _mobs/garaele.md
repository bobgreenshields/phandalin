#### The Banshees Bargain

Garaele has been tasked to under take a delicate mission.  She has been asked to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook.  Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair but she did not appear for her.

Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jewelled silver comb, and persuade her to tell what she knows about the location of the spellbook belonging to the legendary mage named Bowgentle.  She believes that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for the answer.  She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing for their efforts.  See Conybery and Agatha' lair.

#### Harpers

Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.
