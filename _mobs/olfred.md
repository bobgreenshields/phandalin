An ageing hill man with a long white beard.  Olfred has been riding and tending to horses since he was a child in the hills.

He is superb with the horses both on the ground and in the saddle but is well aware that his days as a warrior are long gone.

Friendly to anyone who takes care of their horses.  Although he may say nothing depending on the circumstances, he has nothing but scorn for those that abuse their mounts.

The farm boy, Wes, is his apprentice and has adopted his dislike for those who harm their horses but has not yet learned his master's discretion.
