The guildmaster.  An ambitious and calculating human woman.

* acts as more than a merchant
* closest thing to a governing authority in town
* working to slowly bring Phandalin under her control
* can be a valuable patron
* doesn't know location of Cragmaw Castle
* Redbrands have a goblin minion - might know

#### After Tresendar

* will congratulate the pcs on dealing with the RBs
* and ask what became of Glasstaffs 
* Phandalin has slowly been growing
* before it benefited from being too small for anyone to care about it
* Halia is worried that they soon will
* in fact, that someone may already have noticed it
* that's why she is interested in any letters that Glasstaff had
* were the RBs being orchestrated by a powerful outsider
* there have been reports of digging at [Old Owl Well]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link  _mobs/daran.md %})
* several prospectors chased away by undead
* concerned that this might have something to do with Glasstaff
* someone needs to find out what is going on

#### Halia's job offer

* Redbrands are a problem
* have a base under Tresandar Manor
* offers 100gp to eliminate Glasstaff, the Redbrands leader
* bring her any correspondence and papers from his quarters

Halia wants to take over the Redbrands.  A DC 15 [Wis (Insight) check]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) will reveal she has ulterior motives.
